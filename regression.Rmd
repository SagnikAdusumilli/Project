## Load the cars dataset

```{r}
# do read table, since data file is .data file
cars <- read.table("./data/auto-mpg.data")
# Looks like there is no missing data
#sum(is.na(cars)) printed 0

# column names were present in the website
colnames(cars) <- c("mpg","cylinders","displacement","horsepower","weight","acceleration","model_year","origin","car_name")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
